# Malcolm Bowers Site Feedback: Round 2

## General Feedback
* I personally like your color palette, but I’d suggest something more “professional.” Notice I put that in quotes, it can vary so much between each company; my company would certainly have no issue with it. Take a look at a website I built a couple years ago for a company my buddy owns: [ClearView MC](https://clearviewmc.net/) This would be an example of a safe color palette; in this case, it’s his company palette. I’m going to reference this website a lot, so that you can have some visual representation… especially in my more advanced feedback. At the bare minimum, I’d invert the foreground and background. My personal general rule is… I assume the interviewer is a douche bag. 
* Your overall padding looks so much better! I’d recommend adding just a tad more to your footer, at least to the bottom. 
* Great work implementing the navbar page tracking!
* Awesome job with implementing the foreground separation and max-width of the container. The site is looking far more modern now! 
* The footer overall is looking great! I’d suggest adding either text or a header inside of it, to annotate to the user that those are links. Maybe like a “Find me at” or something. Also, if you are on an actual mobile device (like an iPhone), you’ll notice that the footer is still hiding and not in view… when there is plenty of whitespace to allow it. This does not appear to be an issue on the browser inspector. That’s a big reason why most companies have QA, so that they can test on physical device themselves, since sometimes the inspector doesn’t pull it off. 
* The contact page looks a lot better too. It’s utilizing more of the space available to it now. 
* Try adding a favicon. (The icon next to your website tab title in the browser)
* Consider adding an “About Me” page or something. Talk about who you are, your values (at least professional ones), maybe a photo of you, etc. I’d say this is totally optional, but can be a cool addition. 
* Take a look at your website in the browser inspector on mobile or on your phone. You may notice that your text, especially your paragraphs, are very small and hard to read. I’d recommend implementing a mobile @media breakpoint, to adjust your font sizes and such. You can even adjust padding, margins, etc in here too… to utilize more of your vertical space. 
* Enhance your footer by adding relevant, but not super important information. You could, for example, add the last time your resume was updated in your footer. 
* Enlarge your Youtube video container. Maybe consider a darker background for this page as well. You can even have the YouTube container scale with your site. Checkout the homepage of the site I linked above. 
* Maybe add a small shadow, lightly opaque, around your foreground container. Maybe the left, right and bottom sections, that way you don’t shadow into your title container. Actually, I’d even consider shadow around the left-right of the title container too. 

## Advanced Feedback
I just want to start this section by saying, this is what I would recommend one of my developers to do. Some of this may be too time consuming or challenging; don’t sweat implementing these unless you really want to.
* **Implement Media:**
  * Something like this can really make your site pop. Take a look at the site I linked above. Switch through the pages, you’ll notice the header always has an image of some sort; with the exception of the team page. Try implementing some images that catch the users attention while also being relevant to the page itself. I would avoid full page headers, especially in this scenario, and stick to smaller headers. This would be an example: [Customized Payment Solutions](https://clearviewmc.net/customized-payment-solutions) 
  * Add general media to your webpages. Maybe some icons in your titles. Scroll down on the homepage of the site above, you’ll notice how icons can be used to enhance a title/header. A great place to implement icons would be your contact page. Phone, email, social media icons, etc. 
  * Bring some of your sections to the next level, by adding photos. For example, your *experience section* on your *Resume* page, could have an Air Force PNG logo in it. You could also add photos that are relevant to your sections. And if you really want to take it to the next level, this can be implemented in a split column design. On desktop, have your photo next to your text, where applicable. Here is an example of that: [Reporting Tools](https://clearviewmc.net/reporting-tools) On mobile, have the text wrap below the image. Keep it more simplistic than what I have; consider that I am utilizing the NextJS framework and Tailwind CSS for this website. Which of course, you could implement Tailwind CSS on your site too (I’d avoid NextJS for this project), but that may be a huge lift if you’ve never worked with anything like it before. But it would give you access to grids, mobile first design, etc. And make sure to keep your images small in size, compress their file size by degrading quality if needed. Just try to avoid banding (google image banding if needed). Otherwise, your site may take longer to load. 
* Implement a light pattern in your background. To do this, you’ll need to have a background image (preferably a repeatable one), and your background color layered overtop of it, with an opacity applied. Or, you can go the other way around, just depends on the look you are going for. This will make your site look FAR more modern; especially with a more bold color palette. Reference th is page for example: [Customized Payment Solutions](https://clearviewmc.net/customized-payment-solutions)
* Implement an actual contact form. Ask for Name, email, phone number and body (at a minimum). I’d consider making the phone number optional though, not all interviewers/recruiters want to give their number out. Have this contact form send you an email with the above information. 
* Implement a mobile navbar dropdown. Most sites have these, but you can reference the site I linked above for an example. 
* Switch to a single page website like this one [Home](https://dave-wilson.net/#about) and utilize scroll effects to navigate. You would have to revamp your navbar to be sticky though. Honestly, this can be a huge lift. But if you don’t have a ton of content, it can be beneficial! I like the multi-page layout too though. But just something to try if you wanted to. 
* Add your site navigation to your footer, but keep it minor. You don’t need to track your current page in there either. It’s just for your user, so when they reach the bottom, they can quickly navigate somewhere else. You can also implement a jump too, and allow the user to navigate back to the top of your website with a click. 
* Add buttons. Maybe add a nice button to download your resume, or to jump to the contact page, for example. Heck, in your project page, you can even add a button to check out more of your work, and have it send them to Github. 
* Consider embedding your resume, a good place to do that would be an *About Me* page. This chick does something like that: [About](https://emilysullivanactor.com/about.html)
